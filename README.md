# 4-CC-Pathfinding-Algorithms

This is a Project which will visualize different PathFinding Algorithms. This project is available on https://karan-gandhi.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualiser-Project/

## Meet the various algorithms
### Astar
A* (pronounced "A-star") is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, which is often used in computer science due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency. One major practical drawback is its O(b<sup>d</sup>) space complexity, as it stores all generated nodes in memory. Thus, in practical travel-routing systems, it is generally outperformed by algorithms which can pre-process the graph to attain better performance, as well as memory-bounded approaches; however, A* is still the best solution in many cases.

### Dijkstra
Dijkstra's algorithm (or Dijkstra's Shortest Path First algorithm, SPF algorithm)[1] is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.

The algorithm exists in many variants. Dijkstra's original algorithm found the shortest path between two given nodes, but a more common variant fixes a single node as the "source" node and finds shortest paths from the source to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.
